### RESEARCH INTERESTS

My primary research interests focus on the development of statistical methods for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin interaction (HiC) data analysis, and their application to the genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. In particular, I have developed single-cell aggregated clustering methods (implemented in software SAFE-clustering and SAME-clustering) for flexible, accurate and robust clustering scRNA-seq data. I have also worked on method development and data analysis for Hi-C data, particularly peak calling (MUNIn program) and integration with GWAS and eQTL results. More recently, I worked on the projects using aggregated Cauchy testing framework for rigorous 3D peaking calling, and the projects identifying and characterizing cardiovascular cell types in mouse and the wounding-related cell dynamics in zebrafish.
