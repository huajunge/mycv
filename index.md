I obtained my Ph.D. in Evolutionary Genomics from the Sun Yat-sen University, China, in 2016 working with [Dr. Suhua Shi](http://evolution.sysu.edu.cn/Our_team.html) (advisor) and [Dr. Chung-I Wu](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/bschen/files/Chung-I%20Wu%27s%20Home%20Page.htm). I started my Postdoc in Department of Genetics at UNC Chapel Hill in 2017 working with [Dr. Yun Li](https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/directory/yun-li-phd/) (advisor).

### Research

My primary research interests focus on the development of statistical methods for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin interaction (HiC) data analysis, and their application to the genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. In particular, I have developed single-cell aggregated clustering methods (implemented in software SAFE-clustering and SAME-clustering) for flexible, accurate and robust clustering scRNA-seq data. I have also worked on method develop¬¬¬ent and data analysis for Hi-C data, particularly peak calling (MUNIn program) and integration with GWAS and eQTL results. More recently, I worked on the projects using aggregated Cauchy testing framework for rigorous 3D peaking calling, and the projects identifying and characterizing cardiovascular cell types in mouse and the wounding-related cell dynamics in zebrafish.
